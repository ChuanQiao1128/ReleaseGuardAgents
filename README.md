# ReleaseGuard

CI tells you tests passed. ReleaseGuard tells you whether the thing this PR actually changed was tested.

```text
PR diff -> Capability Graph -> Evidence Plan -> Selected Tests -> PASS/WARN/BLOCK
```

Run the v0.1 demo:

```bash
npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression
```

Expected output:

```text
Decision: BLOCK
Reason: selected high-priority evidence failed.
Report: artifacts/releaseguard/<run_id>/report.md
```

The demo fixture simulates a PR where the discount API regresses invalid codes from HTTP 400 to HTTP 500. ReleaseGuard scans the repo, sees that `/checkout` consumes `POST /api/discount/apply`, selects the existing invalid-discount API test, runs it, and blocks the merge when the selected evidence fails.

## v0.1 support

ReleaseGuard v0.1 is a narrow vertical slice for the demo app only.

It supports:

- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript demo scanning.
- `/checkout` route detection.
- `POST /api/discount/apply` API detection.
- Direct literal frontend calls like `fetch("/api/discount/apply")`.
- Tagged existing API test selection for invalid discount behavior.
- Deterministic change impact fallback when no LLM provider is configured.
- Citation validation for known graph node and edge IDs.
- Selected test execution.
- Deterministic `PASS` / `WARN` / `BLOCK` decisions.
- Markdown reports under `artifacts/releaseguard/<run_id>/report.md`.

It does not support:

- RAG, embeddings, pgvector, or vector search.
- GitHub App, GitHub Actions, OAuth, or webhook integration.
- Generated tests, self-healing tests, or Playwright browser flows.
- OpenAPI diff, contract runners, database migration runners, or dashboards.
- Monorepos beyond this local npm workspace demo.
- Endpoint constants, template literals, axios wrappers, tRPC, GraphQL, generated clients, OpenAPI clients, and dynamic URLs.

## Day 1 demo app

The v0.1 demo app lives in `apps/demo-app`.

It includes:

- `/checkout`, rendered by `src/app/checkout/page.tsx`
- `POST /api/discount/apply`, rendered by `src/app/api/discount/apply/route.ts`
- API tests in `tests/api/discount.test.ts`

Run the demo app tests from the repository root:

```bash
npm test
```

Or run them inside the app:

```bash
cd apps/demo-app
npm test
```

## Run ReleaseGuard v0.1

This environment does not have a git repository, so the regression path is provided as a fixture:

```bash
npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression
```

Expected output:

```text
Decision: BLOCK
Reason: selected high-priority evidence failed.
Report: artifacts/releaseguard/<run_id>/report.md
```

The fixture temporarily applies a bug where invalid discount codes return HTTP 500 instead of HTTP 400, runs the selected existing API test, writes the report, and restores the normal route file.

Scanner artifacts are written to:

- `.releaseguard/capability_graph.json`
- `.releaseguard/coverage_report.md`

## Security note

The demo app is pinned to Next.js 14.x to match the v0.1 framework scanner scope. `npm audit` may report advisories in the Next.js dependency tree. For production use, the scanner should be validated against the current Next.js major version. This demo app is not deployed as a production service.

## Create the regression branch

After committing the passing Day 1 demo app on `main`, create the regression branch. If this directory has not been initialized as a git repository yet, initialize it and make the first `main` commit before running these commands.

```bash
git checkout -b regression-discount-bug
```

Edit `apps/demo-app/src/app/api/discount/apply/route.ts` so the invalid discount path returns HTTP 500 instead of HTTP 400:

```ts
return NextResponse.json(
  { error: "Discount service failed" },
  { status: 500 },
);
```

Verify the regression makes the invalid discount test fail:

```bash
npm test
```

Then commit the regression branch:

```bash
git add apps/demo-app/src/app/api/discount/apply/route.ts
git commit -m "Introduce discount regression"
git checkout main
```
