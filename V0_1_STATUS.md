# ReleaseGuard v0.1 Status

Working scope: implement the v0.1 vertical slice only. No RAG, vector store, GitHub integration, generated tests, Playwright browser flows, OpenAPI diff, dashboard, or benchmark work.

## Milestone 1 - ReleaseGuard package + CLI scaffold

Status: Done

Done:
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Confirmed this workspace has no `.git` directory, so fixture mode is required for the demo regression path.
- Added `packages/releaseguard` workspace package.
- Added CLI entrypoint and argument parsing for `releaseguard run --base <base> --head <head>` and `releaseguard run --fixture demo-discount-regression`.
- Added root `npm run releaseguard -- ...` script.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard -- --runInBand` failed because `--runInBand` is not a Vitest option.
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard` passed.

Issues:
- None remaining.

Next:
- Implement and verify the capability graph schema.

## Milestone 2 - Capability Graph schema

Status: Done

Done:
- Added v0.1 graph schemas for `CapabilityNode`, `CapabilityEdge`, `CapabilityGraph`, `EvidenceRef`, and discrete `ConfidenceLevel`.
- Restricted node types to `file`, `route`, `api`, and `test`.
- Restricted edge types to `defines`, `consumes`, and `tested_by`.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`

Issues:
- None.

Next:
- Implement and verify Next.js route/API scanner, direct fetch scanner, test scanner, graph artifact, and coverage report.

## Milestones 3-5 - Repo Scanner, Direct Fetch Literal Scanner, Test Scanner

Status: Done

Done:
- Added scanner modules for Next.js App Router routes and API handlers.
- Added direct `fetch("/api/...")` literal scanner with unsupported fetch calls marked unresolved.
- Added demo discount API test scanner with explicit `invalid_discount`, `400`, and `error_status` case tags.
- Added scanner artifact writers for `.releaseguard/capability_graph.json` and `.releaseguard/coverage_report.md`.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`

Issues:
- None.

Next:
- Implement and verify change impact fallback, citation validation, and evidence planning.

## Milestones 6-8 - Change Impact Fallback, Citation Validator, Evidence Planner

Status: Done

Done:
- Added deterministic change impact fallback with graph traversal from changed API to consuming route.
- Added strict Change Impact Agent output schema with merge-decision and risk fields rejected.
- Added citation validation for known graph node and edge IDs.
- Added deterministic evidence planner and existing test selector for invalid discount API evidence.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`

Issues:
- None.

Next:
- Implement and verify selected test execution, regression fixture, deterministic decision, markdown report, and CLI pipeline.

## Milestones 9-12 - Executor, Regression Fixture, Decision Engine, Markdown Report

Status: Done

Done:
- Added selected test executor that runs demo app test files and writes `evidence_result.json` plus `test_results.json`.
- Added `demo-discount-regression` fixture file and temporary apply/restore helper.
- Added deterministic decision engine.
- Added markdown report renderer.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run build --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression`
- `npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`

Issues:
- Initial fixture CLI run failed because npm workspace scripts execute from `packages/releaseguard`; fixed CLI repository root discovery and reran successfully.

Next:
- Run final verification suite and update README.

## Milestone 13 - Tests, Verification, README

Status: Done

Done:
- Verified fixture command produces `Decision: BLOCK`.
- Verified generated graph contains `route_checkout`, `api_apply_discount`, a `consumes` edge, and `test_api_discount_invalid`.
- Verified normal demo app tests pass after fixture restore.
- Updated README with v0.1 support boundaries, exclusions, demo command, expected output, and artifact paths.
- Final report generated at `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T121248Z/report.md`.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run build --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression`
- `npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm audit --omit=dev`
- `npm test && npm run build --workspace releaseguard && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression && npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm test && npm run build --workspace releaseguard && npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression && npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`

Issues:
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reports Next.js/PostCSS advisories. npm's suggested fix upgrades to Next 16, which is outside the required Next.js 14 v0.1 demo scope.

Next:
- v0.1 Definition of Done is met.

## v0.1.1 Hardening

Status: Done

Done:
- Added fixture restore test proving `demo-discount-regression` restores the original route file and leaves the normal 400 path intact.
- Strengthened citation validation to reject citations outside the affected graph slice.
- Added negative citation tests for nonexistent capability IDs, nonexistent citation IDs, unrelated graph citations, and forbidden agent fields.
- Added golden-style report renderer test for the BLOCK report.
- Updated scanner limitations to explicitly include endpoint constants, template literals, axios wrappers, tRPC, GraphQL, generated clients, OpenAPI clients, dynamic URLs, and monorepos.
- Updated README first screen with the demo command and expected BLOCK output.
- Added `SECURITY_NOTES.md` documenting the Next.js 14 audit advisory context.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run build --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression`
- `npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm audit --omit=dev`

Issues:
- `npm audit --omit=dev` still reports Next.js/PostCSS advisories. This is documented in `SECURITY_NOTES.md`; npm's suggested fix upgrades to Next 16, outside the v0.1 Next.js 14 scanner scope.
- Latest fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T122134Z/report.md`.

Next:
- Local git repository initialized on `main`.
- Initial commit created.
- Tag `releaseguard-v0.1` created.
- Remote `origin` set to `git@github.com:ChuanQiao1128/ReleaseGuardAgents.git`.
- Push was not run.

## v0.1.2 Missing Evidence Demo

Status: Done

Done:
- Created branch `v0.1.2-missing-evidence`.
- Added `demo-missing-evidence` fixture support.
- The fixture temporarily scans a valid-only discount API test file so `invalid_discount` evidence is genuinely absent from the capability graph.
- Evidence Planner records missing `invalid_discount`, `400`, and `error_status` evidence for high-risk `api_apply_discount`.
- Decision Engine returns `WARN` through the existing high-risk missing-evidence rule.
- Added tests for missing evidence fixture output, fixture restoration, WARN decision path, and missing evidence report content.
- Updated README with BLOCK and WARN demo commands.
- Set ReleaseGuard package tests to run fixture-mutating test files serially to avoid source-file fixture races.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard` initially failed because fixture-mutating tests ran in parallel and temporarily changed the shared demo test file.
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard` passed after disabling package test file parallelism.
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard && npm run build --workspace releaseguard && npm test && npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-missing-evidence && npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`

Issues:
- None currently.
- Latest BLOCK fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T123542Z/report.md`.
- Latest WARN fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T123544Z/report.md`.

Next:
- Commit, tag `releaseguard-v0.1.2`, and push the branch/tag.

## v0.1.3 Docs-only Fast Skip Demo

Status: Done

Done:
- Fast-forward merged `v0.1.2-missing-evidence` into `main` and pushed `main`.
- Created branch `v0.1.3-docs-only`.
- Added `ScopeAnalyzer` classification for `docs_only`, `source_or_test_change`, `config_or_dependency_change`, and `unknown`.
- Added `demo-docs-only` fixture support.
- Docs-only changes are fast-skipped before scanner, impact agent, evidence planner, and selected test execution.
- Decision Engine returns `PASS` with reason `low-risk docs-only change.`
- Added tests for docs-only scope classification, package/config non-docs classification, source non-docs classification, docs-only fixture PASS, and docs-only decision path.
- Updated README first screen with BLOCK, WARN, and PASS fixture commands.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard && npm run build --workspace releaseguard && npm test && npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-missing-evidence && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-docs-only && npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app` initially failed at `npm run build --workspace releaseguard` due to a fixture union type narrowing issue in `diffParser.ts`; fixed by returning the docs-only fixture branch explicitly.
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard && npm run build --workspace releaseguard && npm test && npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-missing-evidence && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-docs-only && npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`

Issues:
- None currently.
- Latest BLOCK fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T124230Z/report.md`.
- Latest WARN fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T124231Z/report.md`.
- Latest PASS fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T124232Z/report.md`.

Next:
- Commit, tag `releaseguard-v0.1.3`, and push the branch/tag.

## v0.1.4 GitHub Actions Self-check

Status: Done

Done:
- Fast-forward merged `v0.1.3-docs-only` into `main` and pushed `main`.
- Created branch `v0.1.4-github-actions`.
- Added CLI `--expect-decision` support.
- Added root `npm run releaseguard:selfcheck` script for the three fixture checks:
  - `demo-discount-regression` -> `BLOCK`
  - `demo-missing-evidence` -> `WARN`
  - `demo-docs-only` -> `PASS`
- Added `.github/workflows/releaseguard.yml` for PR and manual fixture self-checks.
- Workflow installs dependencies, tests, builds, runs self-check, verifies fixture restore, uploads `artifacts/releaseguard`, and writes a job summary.
- Updated README with CI self-check notes.
- Updated run IDs to include milliseconds so fast self-check fixture runs do not overwrite artifact directories.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run build --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run releaseguard:selfcheck`
- `if npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-docs-only --expect-decision BLOCK; then echo unexpected-pass; exit 1; else echo expected-failure; fi`
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard && npm run build --workspace releaseguard && npm test && npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-missing-evidence && npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-docs-only && npm run releaseguard:selfcheck && npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`

Issues:
- None currently.
- Latest BLOCK fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T125811498Z/report.md`.
- Latest WARN fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T125812518Z/report.md`.
- Latest PASS fixture report: `artifacts/releaseguard/20260506T125812894Z/report.md`.

Next:
- `v0.1.4-github-actions` was committed, tagged as `releaseguard-v0.1.4`, pushed, and fast-forward merged to `main`.
- Continue with v0.1.5 real PR diff mode.

## v0.1.5 Real PR Diff Mode

Status: Done

Done:
- Fast-forward merged `v0.1.4-github-actions` into `main` and pushed `main`.
- Created branch `v0.1.5-real-diff-mode`.
- Added `GitDiffProvider` for real changed-file discovery with `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRT <base> <head>`.
- Kept fixture mode and real diff mode on the same downstream scope/scanner/impact/evidence/executor/decision/report pipeline.
- Added a fail-safe `WARN` path for source changes that cannot be mapped to a known capability.
- Added tests for GitDiffProvider, docs-only real diff PASS, discount API real diff mapping, and unmapped source WARN.
- Updated README with real PR diff mode usage and limitations.
- Verified real diff mode against `main..HEAD`; this branch's ReleaseGuard source changes are intentionally unmapped by the v0.1 demo scanner and return fail-safe `WARN`.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run build --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-discount-regression`
- `npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-missing-evidence`
- `npm run releaseguard -- run --fixture demo-docs-only`
- `npm run releaseguard:selfcheck`
- `npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm run releaseguard -- run --base main --head HEAD`

Issues:
- None currently.

Next:
- `v0.1.5-real-diff-mode` was tagged as `releaseguard-v0.1.5`, pushed, and fast-forward merged to `main`.
- Continue with v0.1.6 real diff demo branch documentation and validation.

## v0.1.6 Real Diff Demo Branch

Status: Done

Done:
- Fast-forward merged `v0.1.5-real-diff-mode` into `main` and pushed `main`.
- Created branch `v0.1.6-real-diff-demo`.
- Added README instructions for a real `demo-real-diff-discount-regression` branch using `--base main --head HEAD`.
- Added a real diff pipeline test proving a changed demo discount API file maps to `api_apply_discount`, traverses to `route_checkout`, selects `tests/api/discount.test.ts`, and returns `BLOCK` when selected evidence fails.
- Validated the README branch flow locally with a temporary `demo-real-diff-discount-regression-validation` branch; real diff mode returned `Decision: BLOCK`, then the temporary branch was deleted.

Tests run:
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run build --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm run releaseguard:selfcheck`
- `npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm run releaseguard -- run --base main --head HEAD` on a temporary real regression branch

Issues:
- None currently.

Next:
- `v0.1.6-real-diff-demo` was tagged as `releaseguard-v0.1.6`, pushed, and fast-forward merged to `main`.
- Continue with v0.1.7 GitHub Actions real diff preview.

## v0.1.7 GitHub Actions Real Diff Preview

Status: Done

Done:
- Fast-forward merged `v0.1.6-real-diff-demo` into `main` and pushed `main`.
- Created branch `v0.1.7-actions-real-diff-preview`.
- Updated `.github/workflows/releaseguard.yml` checkout to use `fetch-depth: 0`.
- Kept `npm run releaseguard:selfcheck` as the required fixture validation.
- Added a pull-request-only real diff preview step using `github.event.pull_request.base.sha` and `github.event.pull_request.head.sha`.
- The preview step uses `always()` so it still attempts to write preview output when earlier validation fails.
- Made real diff preview non-blocking by capturing exit code, decision, reason, and report path while exiting the preview step successfully.
- Updated the GitHub Step Summary to include fixture self-check and real diff preview sections.
- Updated README with GitHub Actions real diff preview behavior and limitations.

Tests run:
- `ruby -e "require 'yaml'; YAML.load_file('.github/workflows/releaseguard.yml'); puts 'workflow yaml parsed'"`
- `npm run test --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm run build --workspace releaseguard`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`
- `npm run releaseguard:selfcheck`
- `npm run test --workspace @releaseguard/demo-app`

Issues:
- None currently.
