# Scanner Eval Runbook

ReleaseGuard evaluates scanner coverage before adding browser execution. The
goal is to measure whether the Capability Graph can identify routes, APIs,
tests, and frontend-to-API callsites in repositories beyond the demo app.

## Run Scanner Eval

Clone target repositories outside this repository:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/releaseguard-scanner-eval
cd /tmp/releaseguard-scanner-eval
git clone --depth 1 <repo_url>
```

Run scanner eval from the ReleaseGuard repository:

```bash
npm run releaseguard -- scanner eval --root /tmp/releaseguard-scanner-eval/<repo>
```

ReleaseGuard writes local artifacts under:

```text
.releaseguard/scanner_eval/<repo_name>/scanner_eval_report.md
.releaseguard/scanner_eval/<repo_name>/capability_graph.json
.releaseguard/scanner_eval/<repo_name>/unresolved_report.json
```

Copy the relevant report content into `docs/scanner_eval/reports/`. Do not
vendor external repositories into this repository.

## What To Capture

Each report should record:

- repo name and source URL,
- snapshot commit,
- framework detected,
- whether the current scanner supports it,
- routes detected,
- APIs detected,
- test nodes detected,
- frontend-to-API callsites detected,
- resolved callsites,
- unresolved callsites,
- unresolved rate,
- top unresolved patterns,
- suggested override examples,
- scanner limitation notes.

## Decision Thresholds

Use scanner eval to choose the next milestone:

- unresolved rate `<= 20%`: scanner foundation may be good enough for a
  Playwright/browser evidence runner on supported frameworks.
- unresolved rate `> 20%` and `<= 40%`: scanner is usable for preview, but
  scanner coverage and override UX should improve before enforcement.
- unresolved rate `> 40%`: prioritize scanner expansion and override UX before
  browser execution.
